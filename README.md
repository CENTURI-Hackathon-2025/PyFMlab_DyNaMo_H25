# PyFMlab

## Introduction
PyFMlab is a python based open-source software package designed to extract viscoelastic parameters from both conventional force-distance curves and microrheology measurements obtained via Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).


To enhance readability, maintainability, and reusability, PyFMLab is organized into three self-contained Python libraries

- PyFMReader -  Data import, export and preprocessing of AFM; [Go to PyFMReader](PyFMReader_DyNaMo)
- PyFMRheo -  Data analysis tools and routines; [Go to PyFMRheo](PyFMRheo_DyNaMo)
- PyFMGUI -  A graphical user interface; [Go to PyFMGUI](PyFMGUI_DyNaMo)

## Run software
A zip containing the frozen GUI application can be found and downloaded here:

https://zenodo.org/records/14889564

To run, extract the contents of the .zip and run the main.exe file.

## To Setup and run from source
- Clone the repository
```
git clone  https://github.com/DyNaMo-INSERM/PyFMlab_DyNaMo.git
```
- Create an environment with python 3.9
```
conda create -n yourenvname python=3.9 
conda activate yourenvname
```

- Install the dependencies from requirements.txt
```
pip install -r ./PyFMlab_DyNaMo/PyFMGUI_DyNaMo/requirements.txt
```
- Installing an **editable** version of PyFMReader and PyFMRheo from a local source
```
python3 -m pip install -e ./PyFMlab_DyNaMo/PyFMReader_DyNaMo
python3 -m pip install -e ./PyFMlab_DyNaMo/PyFMRheo_DyNaMo
```

- Launch the GUI 
```
python ./PyFMlab_DyNaMo/PyFMGUI_DyNaMo/src/main.py
```

## Generate executables
If you wish to do any changes to the code and freeze them. You can use PyInstaller and compile an executable for the GUI (OS/platform specific).
```
pyinstaller --onefile --name "name_your_executable" --windowed ./PyFMLAB/PyFMGUI/src/main.py
```

## To Do
- Generate documentation with examples and tutorials
- Improve multiprocessing
- Improve tree control for files (allow to load multiple directories at once and assign folder as group)
- Allow to save analysis sessions and load them after
- Improve error handling and logging
